{% comment %}
Above is the YAML definition of your section. Modify it to match your needs.

To use your section, 2 possibilities:

1. within a dropzone

Make sure that your layouts or your page includes the following liquid tag:

{% sections_dropzone %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of any page including the {% sections_dropzone %}
(or inheriting from a layout including it):

sections_dropzone_content:
- type: "featured_products"
settings:
title: "Repellat recusandae nesciunt sunt."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
blocks: 
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Quisquam expedita dignissimos nobis."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Illo et qui aspernatur."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Magni sint voluptates odit."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"

2. as stand-alone section

{% section 'featured_products' %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of the page including the statement above or complete it.

sections_content:
featured_products:
settings:
title: "Dicta dolor perferendis facilis."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
blocks: 
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Deleniti optio aut hic."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
- type: list_item
settings:
