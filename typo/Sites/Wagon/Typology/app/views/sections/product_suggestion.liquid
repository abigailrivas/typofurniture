Above is the YAML definition of your section. Modify it to match your needs.

To use your section, 2 possibilities:

1. within a dropzone

Make sure that your layouts or your page includes the following liquid tag:

{% sections_dropzone %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of any page including the {% sections_dropzone %}
(or inheriting from a layout including it):

settings:
title: "Qui rerum aliquam corrupti."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
blocks: 
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Laudantium neque mollitia eum."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Voluptatum eum nostrum a."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"
- type: list_item
settings:
title: "Est provident aperiam qui."
image: "/samples/images/default.svg"

2. as stand-alone section

{% section 'product_suggestion' %}

If you want to test this section in your Wagon site, add the following
lines in the YAML section of the page including the statement above or complete it.

sections_content:
